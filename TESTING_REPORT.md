## Known Issues and Limitations

### 1. Browser Mode Component Tests (Critical)

**Issue**: vitest-browser-svelte 1.1.0 screen API undefined

**Impact**:
- 49 component tests failing (20 for Item.svelte, 29 for Friends.svelte)
- 0% coverage on all Svelte components
- Unable to test UI rendering and user interactions

**Root Cause**: API breaking change in vitest-browser-svelte library between versions

**Workaround**: Business logic extracted to separate testable modules where possible

**Long-term Solution** (Options):
1. Wait for vitest-browser-svelte fix/update
2. Migrate to @testing-library/svelte
3. Migrate to Playwright Component Testing
4. Use Tauri WebDriver for E2E tests instead

**Recommended**: Option 3 (Playwright Component Testing) for better stability and ecosystem support

### 2. Tauri API Testing

**Issue**: Can't fully test Tauri-specific code paths in unit tests

**Impact**:
- Tauri store adapter: ~30% coverage
- File system operations: Mocked only
- Deep link handlers: Not tested

**Workaround**:
- LocalStorage adapter provides similar coverage
- Integration tests cover cross-platform behavior

**Solution**: Implement E2E tests with Tauri WebDriver

### 3. Coverage Reporting for UI

**Issue**: V8 coverage doesn't handle Svelte files well

**Impact**: Overall coverage appears low (12.68%) due to large UI files

**Workaround**: Focus on testable business logic modules (86.04% coverage achieved)

**Solution**: Separate coverage reports for logic vs. UI
