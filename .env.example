# Picologs Desktop App - Environment Variables
# Copy this file to .env and fill in the values

# SECURITY NOTE (M7): Discord Client ID
# ======================================
# The Discord Client ID is publicly visible in the compiled application.
# This is acceptable because:
# - Client IDs are not secret (they're exposed in OAuth URLs)
# - The Client SECRET is stored securely on the server, NOT in this app
# - OAuth redirect URIs are validated by Discord to prevent misuse
# - This app uses PKCE flow through website bridge for additional security
#
# IMPORTANT: Never commit .env file to version control
# The .gitignore file is configured to exclude .env files
